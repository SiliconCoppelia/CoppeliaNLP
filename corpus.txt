That we are the same on this, strongly strengthens my conviction. We are much alike, that makes me even more convinced about us. That we are similar in this respect, increases my belief in us. We resemble each other a little; that makes it better somehow. That we aren’t much alike, does not make it any better. That we are different, weakens my belief for that matter. That we disagree, makes me less convinced about us. That we are so different on this, undermines my conviction.
